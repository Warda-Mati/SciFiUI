# Description of the assignment

A UI for a futuristic DJ system, made with Java and Processing with some functions from the Minim library

# Instructions

You are able to click on the buttons labelled 1-16, each will in turn play a diffrent song and labelled 17 -22, which will play beats. You can press s to stop the song from playing and p to play again. As well as that, there are 2 slider bars on the top, around the middle. You are able to click on the bar and slide it down or up then press b to stop controlling the bar. The first one will control the volume of the song playing, while the second one will control the intensity of the light.

# How it works



# What I am most proud of in the assignment

What I am most proud of is the elaborate design I was able to create. It took a lot of classes for each individual element, even for small designs such as lines, but in the end the design turned out to be elegant and colorful. As well as that it just fit in of what I imagined a futuristic neon DJ system would be, not just in the design of the interface but also the funcionality. I'm impressed that I could make some functions such as playing songs and adjusting volume work. Last of all, I'm proud of the concepts of OOP that I have learned and practice I have gained over the month I have been working on the UI.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
